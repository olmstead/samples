This repository contains code samples that I have either provided on request or that were pulled from a personal project.

Weather Data Client/Server
==========================
The task given was to build a simple client and server components to display weather data using an AJAX client and a 
data service.  My implementation uses rudimentary routing and an MVC structure on the server side to perform the data
fetch.  Note that the client is not completely styled and the controls not entirely data driven.
