Bitwise Sum
===========
Problem: Create an application (either web based or cli) that accepts two arguments for input.  
The system should output the sum of the two numbers but without using the native addition or 
subtraction operator within PHP.

Output
======
0 + 0 = 0
2 + 0 = 2
0 + 2 = 2
-4 + 0 = -4
0 + -4 = -4
3 + 5 = 8
-3 + 6 = 3
13 + -8 = 5
