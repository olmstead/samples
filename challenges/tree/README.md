Directory Recursion
-----------------
Problem: Given a directory, retrieve a list of all files within directory and sub-directory (iterative or recursive).

Solution: I think the challenge here was to see if you would write your own recursive method, or use the new file recursion 
objects native to PHP.  I added a little extra by using the depth value to display folder depth as well as 
differentiated between folders as files in the output.
