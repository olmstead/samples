Discrete Math
=============
Problem: For the following function please provide both a recursive and iterative solution for any given input:
f(x) = f(x-1)^3 + f(x-2)^2 + f(x-3)
where f(3) = 3, f(2) = 2, f(1) = 1

Test Data
=========
$test_data = array (1,2,3,4,5,6);

Output
======

Recursive Solution
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) = 3
f(4) = 32
f(5) = 32779
f(6) = 35219817466166

Iterative Solution
f(1) = 1
f(2) = 2
f(3) = 3
f(4) = 32
f(5) = 32779
f(6) = 35219817466166
