The task given was to build a simple client and server components to display weather data using an AJAX client 
and a data service. My implementation uses rudimentary routing and an MVC structure on the server side to perform 
the data fetch. Note that the client is not completely styled and the controls not entirely data driven. 

index.html: simple Javascript client

weather.js: library for connecting to server from client

api.php: entry point for AJAX calls from client

import.js: script for import NOAA data

/assets: css and images

/data: SQL schema and data sample
